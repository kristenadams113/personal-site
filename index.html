        A Little About Me:
      </h3>

      <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is Kristen, and I am a rising senior at a STEM
        high school in New Jersey. When I'm not learning how to code, I am
        either listening to a new audiobook on my back porch or watching Netflix
        movies. I am obsessed with making music playlists on Spotify, and I have
        been playing piano for almost 13 years! My favorite STEM subject is
        biology because the concept of life and death fascinates me more than
        anything in the world, but I am also extremely fascinated by computers
        and how they are able to create projects from code!
