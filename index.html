      Get to Know Me:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Hello everyone! My name is Kristen, and I am a rising senior at a STEM
      high school in New Jersey. When I'm not learning how to code, I am either
      listening to a new audiobook on my back porch or watching Netflix movies.
      I am obsessed with making music playlists on Spotify, and I have been
      playing piano for almost 13 years. My favorite STEM subject is biology
      because the concept of life and death fascinates me more than anything in
      the world, but I am also extremely fascinated by computers and how they
      are able to create projects from code!
    </p>
