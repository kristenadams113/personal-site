      <h4 class="date">August 12, 2020</h4>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Thirteen years ago, I learned how to play the piano for the first time. I had
        my ups, and I had my downs. I threatened to quit multiple times
        throughout the years. But in the end, I grew to love the instrument and
        the different genres of music. Two years ago, I started a local piano
        lessons business, offering affordable lessons to children in my
        neighborhood. Since then, the business has grown to cover three towns,
        fifteen students, and ages ranging from 5 to 15! I am so happy to have
        the opportunity to share the gift of music with others. I also get to
        learn more about piano and myself through teaching!
